The idea on whether or not the use of ChatGPT counts as cheating is dependent on how society (or individual courses) views its use. Additionally, whether or not it should be considered cheating also depends on how it is used. Should it be used simply as a tool to assist with learning, as stated in earlier responses, then I believe that utilizing ChatGPT is not cheating. Using it in this way is similar to looking up questions on the internet to help with topics you are struggling with. This use case functions similarly towards doing independent learning, something I see no issues with. However, using ChatGPT to do assignments for you should always be considered cheating, unless the way college courses are structured changes drastically. 

Another factor to consider is society's opinion on ChatGPT. Should it be decided that ChatGPT is unethical, then using it would be considered cheating. However, if society instead views it as a tool that allows for more efficiency, better products, and more, then its use would not be cheating, assuming it is used in a way that aligns with society's vision of it. 

As of right now, my opinion varies from class to class. In some of my classes, it is recommended that we use ChatGPT to help with certain assignments (assuming we follow several guidelines). In these courses, I agree with the statement from the Podcast. However, several of my classes also explicitly forbid its use. In these courses, I disagree with the statement of the Podcast. Overall, whether or not using ChatGPT is cheating depends on a lot of other factors, including society's opinion, guidelines of courses, how it is used, and more.

The integration of ChatGPT will influence the ethical considerations and responsibilities of computer science professionals in several ways. One such influence ChatGPT will have on the responsibilities of computer science professionals is that of maintaining data privacy. As machine learning continues to be implemented in more fields, the issue of data privacy is a concern that will continue to be relevant. If ChatGPT is trained on data that includes private or sensitive information, then the risk of such information being accessed by unauthorized actors will become more prevalent. Therefore, maintaining such privacy will become more important as time goes on. 

Another influence ChatGPT will have on CS professionals in terms of software development is that of respecting the work required to complete certain tasks. An overreliance on ChatGPT to write code or using what it writes without making your own changes would result in violating this required respect. 

An influence ChatGPT will have on user interactions is that of needing to avoid biases. Having biases in the training data will result in some answers being biased or incorrect, hurting the experience users will have when working with it. Therefore, computer science professionals working within the realm of machine learning will have to do their best to avoid any biases being present in such data. 

The biggest role I envision ChatGPT playing in my own career aspirations is it speeding up the development process of code. Although I am currently not sure what exactly I want to do within the field of computer science after college, ChatGPT's ability to create code will likely continue to increase as it is further developed. Because almost every position that makes use of a CS degree will require at least some programming, this is one of the most universal (and beneficial) features of ChatGPT that will be applicable to my career.

I want to be elected for these roles because I have enjoyed being a part of UCOW over the past 2 years and hope to be able to assist in enabling the club to continue running smoothly, especially after a lot of the current execs graduate. I have also enjoyed my time being involved with leadership for UCOW, including being the captain of UCOW Black last spring and secretary this past year.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
During my tenure as a member on my high school's robotics team, I spent three years as the Software Head and one year as a Co-Captain. Within these leadership roles, I oversaw the team's engineering design notebook, which documented all progress we made both on the robot and as a club throughout the year. Some examples of what would be documented include prototypes for the build, designs made in CAD, failed and successful programs, and any community service we participated in as a club, such as demonstrating our robot's capabilities at underprivileged grade schools around the area to increase enthusiasm and interest in the STEM fields. This notebook would be submitted prior to every competition, and awards would be distributed to teams accordingly. We were always a competitor for the top three in every competition we attended. 

Last fall, I was the notetaker for the enableUC dog prosthetic team. Within this role, I would record minutes for meetings and help keep track of ideas and designs. These designs would then be sent to both the enableUC board and the individuals we were helping. This experience helped me strengthen skills similar to those that I would use while fulfilling my duties as secretary within UCOW.

I served as the captain of UCOW Black in the spring semester of 2022. As captain, I worked to ensure that my team continued to grow, both as players and as teammates. We improved week after week, even reaching the point where we were close to taking maps off of some of the strongest teams in EGF, a gigantic accomplishment for myself and for every single one of my players. While this success was reflective of all the hard work we had put in throughout the semester, individually and as a collective, it also reflected how much effort I put in trying to ensure we improved. From creating color-coded documents to speaking with players on a personal level to see where they fit, I assisted in keeping the team organized and focused while still making room for having fun playing the game we were all there for. 

Throughout the past school year, I have served as the secretary for the UCOW exec board. As secretary, I have taken notes for all exec meetings and have helped with several club events / functions, including the Grand Finals Watch Party and the UC x Miami LAN. I also helped lead UCOW White during both the fall and spring semesters, where I helped the team improve both individually and as a unit. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an Exec Lead for a UCOW team, I would work closely with the team's captain to ensure the semester could be seen as a successful one, regardless of the goals that team sets for themselves at the beginning of the year. To accomplish this mission, I would ensure that every player is put into situations where they can succeed individually and thrive in the team environment. I would serve as another leading voice for the team while keeping myself available on a personal level to all members, encouraging them to come to me with any ideas they may have or problems they may be encountering, whether they be with the team itself or other personal / academic issues. While the team captain will largely be the one in charge of determining individual playtime and specific compositions run on each map, I will give feedback on decisions made and give suggestions that may lead to further development.

Vice President:

I served as the captain of UCOW Black in the spring semester of 2022. As captain, I worked to ensure that my team continued to grow, both as players and as teammates. We improved week after week, even reaching the point where we were close to taking maps off of some of the strongest teams in EGF, a gigantic accomplishment for myself and for every single one of my players. While this success was reflective of all the hard work we had put in throughout the semester, individually and as a collective, it also reflected how much effort I put in trying to ensure we improved. From creating color-coded documents to speaking with players on a personal level to see where they fit, I assisted in keeping the team organized and focused while still making room for having fun playing the game we were all there for. 

Throughout the past two school years, I have served as the secretary for the UCOW exec board. As secretary, I have taken notes for all exec meetings and have helped with several club events / functions, including Grand Finals Watch Parties and the UC x Miami LAN. I played a pivotal role in UC's hosting of the first ever Overwatch Queen City Clash. I assisted with corresponding with other schools, setting everything up to ensure the games could run smoothly, and writing much of the documentation and ruleset sent out. The role I played allowed for our LAN to be considered the "best Queen City Clash that has been run so far." Everything went extremely smoothly, and any and all issues were adapted to and amended as quickly as possible. 

I have been a player for UCOW Red for the past two semesters. As the Main Support for UCOW Red, I serve as the main ult tracker and shot caller for the team. Despite the massive rise in skill level of both my team and those I played against due to my being promoted from UCOW Black, I was still able to play a crucial role in all of our successes. We made the semifinals of both the fall and spring NECC seasons, made the top 70 in Activision Blizzard Collegiate Homecoming, second place in the MEI LAN, and first place in the Queen City Clash. This success on the team that provides the highest level of competition UC has to offer demonstrates my ability to remain calm under pressure while serving as a vocal point of leadership both in and out of game. 

The time I have spent as the captain for UCOW Black, as a player for UCOW Red for the past year, and as the secretary for UCOW for the past two years demonstrates my commitment to UCOW and the experience I will bring to the role of Vice President. I have been a leader in this club since my second semester at UC, and the influence I have had has continued to increase year after year. I hope to take advantage of this experience and lead the club as its Vice President.

Throughout all three of these positions, I have continued to improve and grow as a notetaker and communicator. Going beyond just the responsibility of notetaking, I have also had much experience as a leader within UCOW. I have served as the captain of UCOW Black, a player for UCOW Red, and the secretary for the past two years. This combination of notetaking and leadership capabilities ensures that I will be successful as the secretary for the club.

# AI Use
- I used the following prompt "Using svelte and js, make me a component that will allow me to design floorplans for houses. All floorplans are one floor. Have options for doors, lights, and walls" to get the basic room maker. It was functional. This was useful but only will be used as a basis for future work. Here is an image of what was made

# Affordances
- A smart lightbulb would afford providing light when turned on 
- A smart lightbulb would afford remote control via a mobile app
- A smart lightbulb would afford changing color and brightness
- A smart lightbulb would afford integrating with other smart lightbulbs or devices
